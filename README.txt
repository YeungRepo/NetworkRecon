### This repository contains code for the paper entitled "Discovery of Dynamical Network Models for Genetic Circuits From Time-Series Data with Incomplete Measurements" by Enoch Yeung, Jongmin Kim, Ye Yuan, Jorge Goncalves, and Richard Murray.   More generally, it contains algorithms and data for working examples of dynamical structure reconstruction, a theory first piloted by Sean Warnick and Jorge Goncalves.
